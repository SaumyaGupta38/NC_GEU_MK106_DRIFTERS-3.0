        A life in the foreign service is all about becoming a Diplomat, travelling the world all the while serving the nation. It may sound too good to be true, but Indian 
        Foreign Services offers you just that, and more.

        <h3>Job Role –</h3> IFS officers are representatives of our country abroad, and are posted as Third Secretary, Second Secretary, First Secretary, Ambassador, High 
        Commissioner, etc. in foreign embassies, and international organizations such as the UN. They are provided decent accommodation, a car, and other housing and basic
        amenities. Education expenses of children (up to 2) are borne by the Government of India, which are a few of the perks enjoyed by an IFS Officer.

        <h3>A Day in the Life –</h3> An IFS officer is often posted in a foreign country, mostly in capital cities. Working hours of 9-to-5 apply to IFS officers, and their day 
        is spent making calls to embassies/international organizations, reading and replying to emails to foreign delegates or back home, following up with the Ministry of External
        Affairs, attending meetings and other important social events.
