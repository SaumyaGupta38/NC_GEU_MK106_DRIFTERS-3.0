            TRUE MENTOR is a platform to show right direction. Actually it is a solution of problem statement of <b>Government of Uttarakhand</b> to develop a <b>Carrer Counselling
            Software.</b>To find its solution we have gone through a study and found that 42% people don't enjoy their jobs,92% don't get any carrer related guidance from schooling,
            Parents and childrens are stressed about which carrer they should choose and if they choose any field after some time they find that it is not the field suitable for
            them and feels uncomfortable with their work. This is the reason that the <b>Team Drifters3.0</b> from <b>Bhagalpur College Of Engineering,Bihar</b> implemented a software based on
            a Psychometric test completely takes users interest as input and give them a suitable carrer to being comfortable in that field .We have tried to provide all essential 
            things in one platform.<br>
        </h3> 
        <h2><b>How it works?</b></h2>
        <h3>
            Basically this software is based on <b>Artificial Intelligence</b>. You have to just register yourself and take a quiz which will be based on your interest not your knowledge.
            The quiz has various levels like post matric,post intermediate,post graduation,proffesional, you have to choose your level also and after complemeting the quiz 1 or 2 
            carrer will be predicted according to your choosen answer. After this you will be directed to a page that will contain the description of your predicted carrer, along
